<h1 id="Hourofcodeid">HOUR OF CODE</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h4>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp On March 31, our team №9 went to school №145 for the Hour of Code event. There were more than 60 students in the assembly hall.
At the beginning of the event, we opened a presentation about ADA University and talked about its advantages, how to apply, 
and highlighted that the university utilizes modern equipment and hosts a large number of local and international students. 
During the presentation, Ismail and Nihad talked about ADA University. 
Ismail spoke in Russian, while Nihad spoke in Azerbaijani, allowing us to explain to a larger audience what ADA is. 
We mentioned that Professors and students of this university receive numerous awards for their achievements in various competitions.</h4>

<h1>After that, we began to ask people if they had any questions:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Would it be wise to invest in an ADA university now when considering spending money on a university abroad?</b>
    </li>&nbsp &nbsp 
    The answer to this was that living abroad is much more expensive than in Azerbaijan, 
    and it will be psychologically difficult to live alone abroad, and ADA University is a European University,
    which means that it is better to study in ADA than abroad
    <li>
        <b>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next question was about how we get to know other students in the class</b>
    </li>&nbsp &nbsp
    Firstly, Ismail clarified that there are no traditional classes in ADA, in fact,
     studying is a set of courses where you can find people with a common schedule,
      and we already get to know these people, depending on the language,
       we communicate either in our native language or in English
    
</ul>
<h1>Hour of Code</h1>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp &nbsp Firstly, we explained that the Hour of Code takes place worldwide from December 4th to 10th. 
  Then, we introduced the Code.org website and the maze-related tasks on it. 
  We showed the students how to work with the module and explained all the levels. During the coding session, many students asked questions in Russian and Azerbaijani language, so we helped and explained to them. 
  We also provided our laptops for them to solve some tasks independently.
  We gave them links to the website so that they could practice coding and complete all the tasks independently.</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    At the end of the event, we also answered various questions that interested the students.
     Afterward, the director thanked us, and we gathered our belongings and left.
Due to unforeseen circumstances, one of our groupmates was delayed by half an hour.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    One of the biggest challange was translating my words to Azerbaijani language.
  </li>
</ul>
