            <h1>Team â„–9 called AlphaCoders created this site thanks to our professor Araz Yusubov who provided us with courses by code-academy</h1>
            <h2>Fetures of our site:</h2>
            <h4>
                <ol>

                        The home page of the site has a dynamic time and current date
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Depending on the time of day, the background of all sites will change. 
                        From 6AM to 5PM there will be a picture of a day campus,
                        from 5PM to 10PM there will be an evening campus, from 10PM to 6AM there will be a night campus

                        Portraits of participants have 2 functions at once, firstly they work as links to a site with information about the participants, 
                        the second function is to scroll through the page directly to the information about member which you clicked on, skipping the beginning of the page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Page about Hour of code has pictures, you can click on pictures and make them bigger. Also we have names with links,
                        these links have same functionality as pictures from home page
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </h4>
            <h2>Challenges we faced</h2>
            <ol><b>
                <li>
                    Coming up with a design. We had several patterns, however our team chose Ismail's pattern with main information
                    in the center and changable background. Also design for other pages was also done by Ismail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creation of functionality for the site. Our team desided to add current date and time on the top of Home page. 
                    Ismail gave idea for our portrait icons design and their functionality. Also he provided the functionality for 
                    our pictures on the Hour of Code site.
                </li>
