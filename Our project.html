            <h1>Team №9 called AlphaCoders created this site thanks to our professor Araz Yusubov who provided us with courses by code-academy</h1>
            <h2>Fetures of our site:</h2>
            <h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The home page of the site has a dynamic time and current date
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Depending on the time of day, the background of all sites will change. 
                        From 6AM to 5PM there will be a picture of a day campus,
                        from 5PM to 10PM there will be an evening campus, from 10PM to 6AM there will be a night campus
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Portraits of participants have 2 functions at once, firstly they work as links to a site with information about the participants, 
                        the second function is to scroll through the page directly to the information about member which you clicked on, skipping the beginning of the page
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Page about Hour of code has pictures, you can click on pictures and make them bigger. Also we have names with links,
                        these links have same functionality as pictures from home page
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </h4>
            <h2>Challenges we faced</h2>
            <ol><b>
                <li>
                    Coming up with a design. We had several patterns, however our team chose Ismail's pattern with main information
                    in the center and changable background. Also design for other pages was also done by Ismail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creation of functionality for the site. Our team desided to add current date and time on the top of Home page. 
                    Ismail gave idea for our portrait icons design and their functionality. Also he provided the functionality for 
                    our pictures on the Hour of Code site.
                </li>
            </b></ol>
            <h2>Contributions:</h2>
            <h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMammadov Ismayil (20577) [75%]: Team Leader, wrote 98% of the entire code for the site in html files, and 100% of the code in JS and CSS files 
                also the developer of all designs for the site and responsible for the development of all functional parts of the sites.
            </h4>
            <h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMusayeva Aylin (19274) [5%]: Prepared information about herself.</h4>
            <h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBabazade Jamal (19586) [15%]: Prepared information about himself and wrote code for his own part of page on the site <a href="Members.html">Members.html</a>. </h4>
            <h4>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMustafayev Nihad (19620) [5%]: Prepared information about himself</h4>
            <!--Dear Professor, I want to leave this secret message to you and 
                I want to inform you about the scam from Mustafaev Nihad, 
                I personally watched how, instead of solving problems on Code-Academy, 
                he used the feature “show solution” and thus solved all problems on the Code-Academy platform, 
                also when I asked him to create his own page for our project, 
                he sent a very suspicious screenshot of his website which I would place in the Media folder called Cheater.jpg, 
                and after I told him to upload his code to website-team-09 Github he refused and decided to send me a link to his own Github page, 
                here it is “ https://github.com/nmustafayev19620/Personal-Information/blob/9ff0e068b6c17fdf85127fe88551a7b7227ff38f/README.md ” 
                and then I realized that he just “drew” a page for himself (probably via Paint) without typing a single line of code, 
                and he didn't want you to see it on our group page. He was not capable of creating a website and participating in helping the group. 
                I'm just informing you, I hope you find this message and take appropriate action against Nihad.-->
